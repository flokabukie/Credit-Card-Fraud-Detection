# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
 This project is to build an advanced fraud detection system using neural networks to identify transactions that appear unusual and potentially fraudulent. By applying object-oriented programming (OOPs) concepts, we aim to develop a scalable and modular solution that can handle large volumes of data and provide valuable insights to Company ABC.
