# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
 This project is to build an advanced fraud detection system using neural networks to identify transactions that appear unusual and potentially fraudulent. By applying object-oriented programming (OOPs) concepts, we aim to develop a scalable and modular solution that can handle large volumes of data and provide valuable insights to Company ABC.

### *Overview*
The Credit Card Anomaly Detection project focuses on identifying suspicious transactions within credit card data. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, including Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, and Local Outlier Factor, this system provides an efficient solution for fraud detection.

### *Key Features*
**Multiple Algorithms**

Utilizes Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, and Local Outlier Factor for anomaly detection, allowing for comprehensive coverage.

**Data Preprocessing** 

Includes data scaling and standardization for improved model performance.

**Interactive Interface**

 A user-friendly interface enables easy input of transaction details for real-time anomaly detection.

**Visual Insights** 

Provides visualizations of anomaly scores and location plots for better understanding and decision-making.

### *Models*
**Isolation Forest:**
 A machine learning algorithm for detecting anomalies based on the fact that anomalies are typically far from the majority of data points.

**DBSCAN:**
 A density-based clustering algorithm that identifies regions with a high density of data points as clusters.

**Local Outlier Factor (LOF):** A method for detecting outliers in a dataset by measuring the local deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbors.

### *Results*
Precision, recall, and AUC-PR scores for each model.

Visualizations demonstrating the performance and effectiveness of the algorithms.

### *Deployment*

This project includes a Streamlit web application that has been deployed on Hugging Face.
